# My First Test Post

Welcome to the **first test post**! This is an example of how an MDX file can be structured with content that is both _dynamic_ and static. The purpose of this file is to test the layout, rendering, and features of your blog template.

## Section 1: Introduction

This post is written in **MDX** (Markdown + JSX). You can include:

- Regular Markdown syntax
- JSX components
- Code snippets

Here's an example of a code snippet in JavaScript:

```js
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
sayHello('World');
